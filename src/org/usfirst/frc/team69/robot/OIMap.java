/**
 * This file specifies what joysticks/buttons are used, and what ports they are on.
 * It also lets us tie buttons to commands, e.g. "run this command while this button
 * is held".  This file is also read to make diagrams of what button does what.
 * This file is read by the OI class on startup.
 * 
 * This is organized into inner classes, one for each joystick.  Inside each inner 
 * class, declare command objects, with annotations for WhileHeld, WhenPressed, etc.
 * 
 * If you want to actually access the joystick object (like to read values from it for
 * driving), use the corresponding method in the OI class (not this class).
