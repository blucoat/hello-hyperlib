 * This class specifies a bunch of constant port numbers. This helps keep things
 * organized by putting all the port numbers in one place. The "Port" annotation
 * doesn't affect the code in any way, but it does allow you to generate neat
 * diagrams and check for common mistakes.
 * 
 * We like to organize this into "inner classes" corresponding to each subsystem.
 * This doesn't affect the code, it just helps with organization.
